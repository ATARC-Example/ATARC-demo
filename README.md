# Adding New Pages

Before being able to add a new page to an ATARC working group, please complete the following checklist:
* I am a member of the ATARC-Example github organization
* I am familiar with Jekyll headers
* My content is important enough to demand an entirely new page

## Becoming a member of the ATARC-Example Github Organization
Currently, an administrator of ATARC-Example must manually invite users in order to join. If you would like to collaborate, please contact your task-lead to be added to the group.

## Using Jekyll Headers
Jekyll using YAML Front Matter to help render each page. It is required by jekyll that every post begins with:

```
---
layout: page
title: my title
---
```

This snippet indicates the new page you are creating uses the 'page' template, and has the title 'my title'.
New templates can be created for pages that serve different purposes, but for right now just use the 'page' template.

## Collaboration vs Contribution
This doesn't make sense?
