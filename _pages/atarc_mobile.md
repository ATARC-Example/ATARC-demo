ATARC is the Advanced Technology Academic Research Center. They are a 501c3 non-profit that provides a collaborative service for federal government, academia, and industry. They introduce innovative technologies and ideas to the government and industry.

What is a working group and what is its function?

ATARC sets up working groups among professionals from academia, industry, and the federal government. Each group is shared by an “industry thought leader”. Basically a collaborative space for experts on specific topics to come together and better academia, industry, and the fed. Each working group is broken up into “subject” teams

How are products created at ATARC?

Technologies are researched in groups (working groups, and below that, teams). A proposal is put forth and then vetted by members of the working group. At the end of the process, a new technology has be created that benefits everyone.

What is ATARC’s relationship with the government?

Not owned by the government, contributes technology to the government with the help of key government leaders in its creation (sort of a hands on sponsor).
