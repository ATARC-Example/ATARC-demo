# Adding New Pages

Before being able to add a new page to an ATARC working group, please complete the following checklist:
* I am a member of the ATARC-Example github organization
* I am familiar with Jekyll headers
* My content is important enough to demand an entirely new page

## Becoming a member of the ATARC-Example Github Organization

## Using Jekyll Headers
Jekyll using YAML Front Matter to help render each page. It is required by jekyll that every post begins with

{% highlight markdown %}
---
layout: page
title: my title
---
{% endhighlight %}

## Collaboration vs Contribution
This doesn't make sense?

## Ready to get started?
