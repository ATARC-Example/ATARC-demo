# Adding New Pages

Before being able to add a new page to an ATARC working group, please complete the following checklist:
* I am a member of the ATARC-Example github organization
* I am familiar with Jekyll headers
* My content is important enough to demand an entirely new page

## Becoming a member of a ATARC-Example

## Using Jekyll Headers

## Collaboration vs Contribution
This doesn't make sense?

## Ready to get started?
Make a new page! <p><a href="https://github.com/ATARC-Example/ATARC-demo/new/master/_pages">New Page</a></p>
